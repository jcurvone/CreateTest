Hello everyone! 
My name is Joaquim Curvo, I'm 29 years old and I live in Beacon-NY. I moved to the US 5 years ago from Brazil. 
My background is in Operations Management. I started my career working for a chemical manufacturer in Brazil where I learned the business from bottom to top executing many roles ranging from production floor manager to front sales role all the way up to General Manager. 
After 5 years I moved to the US for my MBA to pursue my career goals. 
My main career goal is to create my own business in the financial/fintech industry. They say it's all about the journey so until there I devote my self to do my best in each role I'm in. 
I chose Fintech because it's the future and there still be plenty on opportunities in the industry.
